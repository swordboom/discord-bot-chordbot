## üîê Bot Token Configuration

Open the existing `config.json` file in the root directory and add your Discord bot token and application ID like this:

```json
{
  "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
  "application_id": 123456789012345678
}
```

* Replace `"YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"` with your actual bot token.
* Replace `123456789012345678` with your bot's **Application ID** (found in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).

> üîí Never commit this file to public repositories.
> Make sure it's listed in your `.gitignore`:

```
config.json
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Bot

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the bot with:

```bash
python bot.py
```

* On startup, the bot will automatically sync all slash commands with Discord. This may take a few seconds.
* Ensure your bot has appropriate permissions in the Discord server, including:

  * Send Messages
  * Connect and Speak in Voice Channels
  * Use Application Commands (slash commands)

* Format: `.mp3`
* Filenames should match the names used in `/play` without the extension.

Example:

```
song-lib/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lovely.mp3
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thunderstruck.mp3
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chill-vibes.mp3
```

To play `lovely.mp3`, use:

```bash
/play lovely
```
