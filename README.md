## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or above  
- `ffmpeg` installed and accessible via your system PATH (required for audio streaming)  
- A Discord bot application with token and **application commands (slash commands)** enabled  
- Basic knowledge of Python and Discord bots  

---

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-modular-slash-bot.git
   cd discord-modular-slash-bot
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Install ffmpeg**
   
   Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html, add to PATH
   Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg or your distroâ€™s equivalent
   macOS: brew install ffmpeg (if Homebrew installed)

---

## Bot Token Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with your Discord bot token:

    ```json
    {
    "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
Never commit this file to public repositories. Use .gitignore to exclude it:

    ```json
    config.json

---

## Running the Bot

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

Install required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then start the bot with:

    ```bash
    python bot.py

\* On startup, the bot will automatically sync all slash commands with Discord. This may take a few seconds.

\* Ensure your bot has appropriate permissions in the Discord server, including:

\* Send Messages

\* Connect and Speak in Voice Channels

\* Use Application Commands (slash commands)

## Song Library

All music files should be stored in the `song-lib/` folder.

- Format: `.mp3`
- Filenames should match the names used in `/play` without the extension.

Example:
```
song-lib/
  â”œâ”€â”€ lovely.mp3
  â”œâ”€â”€ thunderstruck.mp3
  â””â”€â”€ chill-vibes.mp3
```

To play `lovely.mp3`, use:

```bash
/play lovely
```
